4)List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML.
Answer:-
Use Semantic HTML Elements: Utilize semantic HTML elements to provide clear and structured content. Semantic elements, such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <article>,
help screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the document's structure. Using the appropriate semantic elements makes your content more comprehensible and navigable for all users.

Provide Alternative Text for Images: Include descriptive alternative text (alt text) for all images on your web pages. Alt text serves as a textual description of an image and is crucial for users who are visually impaired or have images disabled.
 Make sure the alt text conveys the purpose or content of the image accurately. For decorative or non-essential images, use empty alt attributes (alt="") to indicate they have no informational value.

Keyboard Accessibility: Ensure that all interactive elements and content on your website can be accessed and operated using a keyboard alone. This is essential for users who rely on keyboard navigation or other assistive technologies.
 Test your site's keyboard accessibility by tabbing through links, form controls, and other interactive elements. Ensure that focus indicators are clearly visible and well-styled.
